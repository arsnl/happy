## Versioning convention

This project apply the [Semantic Versioning convention](https://semver.org/).

All breaking changes will bump the major version. Every new rule addition will be recognized as a breaking changes. Therefore, every new rule addition will increase the major version.

## Packages versioning

All packages use the same version. That mean, if one package change, all the packages version will be changed for the new one. By doing that we make sure there's no cross version issues.
