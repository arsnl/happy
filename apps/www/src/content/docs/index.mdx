Are you ready to get Peppy?

The easiest and most hassle-free way to get started is with our auto-installer â€” it's like a magic wand that makes all your configuration dreams come true.

Give it a go and see for yourself by running the following command at the root of your project:

```bash
npx peppy@latest init
```

See the [CLI section](/docs/cli) for more information.
