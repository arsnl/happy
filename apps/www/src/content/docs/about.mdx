## History

[Peppy](https://peppy.arsnl.dev) is a project by [arsnl](https://arsnl.dev).

After collaborating with diverse teams on numerous projects, he recognized
a common pain point: the hours wasted on configuring ESLint, TypeScript,
Prettier, and code editors. He witnessed the frustration, the hair-pulling,
and the lost productivity that stemmed from mismatched setups.

This experience ignited his drive to create Peppy. With a vision to
simplify the development landscape, he crafted a tool that eliminates
the confusion and hassle. Peppy streamlines setups, harmonizes tools,
and enhances collaboration, ensuring developers can focus on coding,
not configuration.
