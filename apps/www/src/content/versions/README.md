# Version files

Files inside this directory are **partially autogenerated** by the scripts `pnpm next` and `pnpm bump`.

It's important to understand how these files are generated and how to use them before editing them.

## File structure

Here is an example of the structure of a version file.

```mdx
---
publishedDate: 2023-09-08T19:27:22.970Z
ruleChanges:
  [
    {
      "configKey": "base",
      "jsState": "introduced",
      "ruleKey": "no-useless-backreference",
      "tsState": "introduced",
    },
    {
      "configKey": "prettier",
      "jsState": "introduced",
      "ruleKey": "vue/no-multi-spaces",
      "tsState": "introduced",
    },
    {
      "configKey": "react",
      "jsState": "introduced",
      "ruleKey": "react/sort-prop-types",
      "tsState": "introduced",
    },
    {
      "configKey": "tailwindcss",
      "jsState": "introduced",
      "ruleKey": "tailwindcss/no-contradicting-classname",
      "tsState": "introduced",
    },
  ]

Peppy is evolving with stricter code quality checks and better customization options. We've also updated dependencies and provided enhanced documentation to ensure smoother usage.

- Introduced stricter code quality checks based on community feedback.
- Updated dependencies to ensure compatibility with ESLint and related tools.
- Added support for custom ESLint plugins and configurations.
- Improved error messages and rule descriptions for better developer understanding.
- Enhanced the documentation with advanced configuration examples.
```

- The `publishedDate` property represent the date the version was published. This value is autogenerated when the version file is generated so you don't have to edit the value manually. If you have to manually enter this value, use any date format that is compatible with the `Date` constructor.
- The `ruleChanges` property represent a list of rule changes that were made to the rules in the version. This value is autogenerated when the version file is generated so you don't have to edit the value manually.
- The body of the file is the description of the changes made in the version. The body is not required, but recommended. You can edit the body manually as it is not autogenerated.

## File generation

The version files are generated when the scripts `pnpm next` or `pnpm bump` are executed. The next script will generate a `next.mdx` file and the bump script will generate a version file with a semantic version number corresponding to the current version listed in the package.json file of the library.

Before using the bump script, you need to have a `next.mdx` file since the bump implies that there are some changes.

The version file generation process is as follows:

- Check if there are any `next.mdx` file with a body and keep the body in memory if it's the case.
- Delete the `next.mdx` file.
- Check if there are any rule changes in the current version.
- If there are body or rule changes, the script will generate a new version file with the body and/or rule changes. This way, it's possible to generate a version file without any rule changes (e.g: for bug fixes).

## Next version without rule changes

The easiest way to generate a new next version file is with the `pnpm next` script. However, this script will only generate a new next version file if there are rule changes.

If you want to generate a new next version file without rule changes, you can simply create a `next.mdx` file with a body.

```mdx
---
publishedDate: Use any date format that is compatible with the `Date` constructor
ruleChanges: []

This update addresses a critical bug identified in Peppy, ensuring a more reliable and error-free linting experience.

- Fixed a critical bug causing incorrect reporting of unused variables.
- Improved error handling and reporting for better debugging.
- Verified compatibility with ESLint versions 7.0 and above.
- Minimal impact on existing configurations; no rule changes introduced.

In this bugfix release, we've resolved a critical issue related to variable detection, enhancing the overall reliability of Peppy. We recommend updating to this version to benefit from these improvements.
